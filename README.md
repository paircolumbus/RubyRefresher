# Ruby Refresher

__Skill Level:__ Beginner  

At this point, it's really important that you work on building your own scripts whether it'd be a game or a tool that you can use. This alone will advance your learning far beyond what any tutorial or reading can do for you.

## Instructions
- Clone this repo and navigate to the project folder
- Run `bundle`
- Run your `rspec` tests
- Replace all `_fill_in_` markers in `refresher_spec.rb` with the method or object needed to make the tests pass
- If you get stuck, feel free to use IRB

## Considerations
This challenge is loosely based on Neo's popular RubyKoans if you haven't given those a try, I'd highly recommend them.
